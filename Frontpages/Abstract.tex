    The potential impact of smartphones in the improvement of personal health outcomes is staggering. Found everywhere, in the pockets of billions around the world, truly ubiquitous, a mobile portal to all of mankindâ€™s information\ldots yet the current health model has not adapted adequately to facilitate their arrival, and perhaps rightly so. There are an unprecedented number of health apps available to the public, for which the benefit of adopting, and their true efficacy, is yet to be established. This work focuses on addressing this issue, exploring the perceived barriers and keys to adoption, proposing a number of solutions which utilise and extend the knowledge in the areas of context-aware computing and behaviour change, and evaluates their efficacy in two longitudinal, smartphone facilitated, health interventions, both in the areas of dementia treatment and prevention.
